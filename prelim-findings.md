## Preliminary findings
_PLEASE NOTE: These findings are preliminary and still subject to review and change._

In arguments that led to the latest court-ordered redraw of North Carolina's legislative maps, attorneys for the voters suing the state argued that many House and Senate districts were skewed too far in favor of Republicans. A three-judge panel agreed, writing that the maps amounted to a partisan gerrymander that violated the North Carolina constitution.

Expert witness and Duke University Mathematics Professor Jonathan Mattingly used thousands of automatically generated maps to resort votes from several statewide elections. That generated distributions of how often Republican or Democratic candidates would win in differently carved up districts.

Those distributions, judges said, helped demonstrate how the actual maps performed relative to what's "normal."

So WRAL News repeated that analysis, resorting votes from 2016 statewide races to see how Republicans and Democrats would perform under the maps drawn by legislators in September 2019.

### Overview

Based on our preliminary analysis so far, the remedial maps drawn in 2019 show an average gain of 3.4 Democratic wins in the North Carolina House and 2.8 Democratic wins in the North Carolina Senate, compared to the previous versions of the two chambers' maps.

Given that average - and using 2016 election data - the new maps would yield an average of about 47 Democratic seats in the N.C. House (out of 120) and an average of about 21 Democratic seats in the N.C. Senate (out of 50).

On average using 2016 data, the new House maps produce as many Democratic wins as about 63 percent of the ensemble maps. That's compared to about 12 percent of the ensemble maps in the old version.

On average using 2016 data, the new Senate maps produce as many Democratic wins as about 75 percent of the ensemble maps. That's compared to about 0.04 percent of the ensemble maps in the old version.
